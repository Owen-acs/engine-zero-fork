# Contributing to Engine Zero

This document defines the rules for contributing to Engine Zero, how the code may be used, and who holds rights over the project.

By contributing, you agree to all terms below.

---

## How to Contribute

- Contributions must be submitted via pull requests
- Do not push directly to the `main` branch
- Keep pull requests focused and clearly explained
- Major architectural changes should be discussed before submission

The project owner has final authority over all decisions.

---

## Project Ownership & Authority

Engine Zero is owned and controlled by the project owner.

The project owner retains final authority over:
- which contributions are accepted
- the project direction and architecture
- licensing decisions
- commercial usage

Submitting a contribution does **not** grant ownership, control, or decision-making power over the project.

---

## Licensing Model (Important)

Engine Zero uses **dual licensing**.

### Open-Source License
The public GitHub repository is licensed under:

**GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**

This allows:
- viewing the source code
- modifying the code
- contributing improvements
- using the code in open-source projects that also comply with AGPL-3.0

This does **not** allow:
- closed-source use
- proprietary or commercial use
- embedding Engine Zero into paid or closed products

---

### Commercial License

Any commercial, proprietary, or closed-source use requires a **separate commercial license** issued by the project owner.

This includes (but is not limited to):
- commercial games
- closed-source engines
- proprietary tools
- paid services

Commercial licenses are negotiated separately and may include additional terms and restrictions.

---

## Licensing of Contributions

By submitting a contribution, you agree that:

- Your contribution is licensed under AGPL-3.0
- Your contribution may be used in both the open-source and commercial versions of Engine Zero
- You do not retain separate licensing rights over your contribution

This ensures Engine Zero can remain dual-licensed.

---

## Forks & Derivative Works

Forks of Engine Zero must comply with AGPL-3.0.

You may not:
- relicense Engine Zero as proprietary
- use Engine Zero as the base for a closed-source engine
- claim Engine Zero or its derivatives as your own original work

---

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive.

Harassment, hostility, or deliberate disruption of the project will not be tolerated.
