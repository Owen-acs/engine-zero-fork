# Engine Zero

Engine Zero is a world-generation engine designed to support unbounded exploration without predefined world borders.

Instead of relying on fixed-size maps or hard limits, Engine Zero generates content on demand, with the only practical limits being the user’s hardware and runtime constraints.

## Goals
- No predefined world borders
- Stable generation at extreme distances
- Deterministic, reproducible worlds
- Designed for long-running worlds

  ## limits:
The way engine zero works limits world size based on alocated storange, The world is limited by storage.

## Status
Early development. Internal systems and APIs may change.
